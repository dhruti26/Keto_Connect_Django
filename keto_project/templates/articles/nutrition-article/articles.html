  <p> <h3>What Can You Drink on Keto? Top Beverages to Keep You in Ketosis</h3></p>
</div>
<article class="article-1">
  <p class = "abc"> One of the biggest challenges for those who want to stick with the keto diet is finding beverages that they enjoy. While water is arguably the best option no matter what your diet, some people prefer a little more flavor from time to time. Unfortunately, many popular drinks like milk and soda are off the table because they contain too many carbs to keep your body in ketosis. So, what can you drink on keto instead?If you want some flavor in your diet and water just is not going to cut it for you, here is a handy list of keto-friendly beverage alternatives to keep you hydrated.
   <br><b>Flavored Seltzer or Sparkling Water </b><br>
    Plain water is no longer your only option for getting the hydration benefits of this beverage. Soda companies have cashed in on the idea that people want a little flavor to their water along with the pleasant fizz of a fresh can of soda. Be sure to look at the label and purchase only unsweetened carbonated water. Some sparkling waters are not just flavored but also sweetened, which you’ll want to avoid.
    
    Another option is to buy plain seltzer water and add a twist of lemon or lime. This comes with a small carb count (usually about half of a gram), but the extra flavor might be worth it for you..When tea simply will not hit your caffeine cravings, the good news is that coffee is not entirely off the table for the keto diet. The best thing for those on a keto diet is to drink it black without the addition of sweeteners or the highly-processed creamers you might be used to. If you do need to add a little something extra to make it palatable, a splash of heavy cream will do the trick.r those who are looking for something to drink later in the day, stick to caffeine-free herbal teas, which have their own healthy properties. Chamomile is great for inducing sleep, peppermint and ginger can calm the stomach, and hibiscus can curb some of your sweet cravings. Spend a few minutes in the tea aisle at your local grocery store and you are likely to find herbal tea that appeals to you. Because dairy generally has too high of a carb count to keep your body in ketosis, you might need to find a quick substitute that allows you to eat cereal, oatmeal, or other goodies that used to require traditional milk. Fortunately, the supermarket makes it easy to nix the dairy from your diet with the popularity of nut milks like almond and coconut (macadamia nut milk and cashew milk are also good choices).</p>

    <p><b>Benefits of High-Sulfur Foods on Keto</b></p>

<article class="article-2">
  <p class = "abc"> You don’t just eat food for pleasure; food also nourishes your cells and keeps you alive. Healthy foods can help you feel better and help your cells function optimally, while unhealthy junk foods harm your overall health and wellness. 

    Just because you’re following a ketogenic diet doesn’t mean you’re necessarily consuming a healthy, nutrient-dense diet. Making sure to include foods in your diet that are rich in necessary minerals like potassium, calcium, and sulfur will help you achieve a more balanced and nutritious diet. Let’s look at the specific benefits of sulfur-rich foods in your ketogenic diet. 
    
    <br><b>What Is Sulfur?</b><br>
    Sulfur is a nonmetallic chemical element and an anti-inflammatory nutrient you must obtain from your diet. Calcium, phosphorous, and sulfur are the three most abundant minerals in the human body.
    
    Which Foods Are High in Sulfur?
    You can source sulfur from plant and animal foods, such as:<b>
    Meat
    Seafood
    Poultry
    Dairy
    Eggs
    Nuts
    Seeds
    Certain grains</b>
Some foods provide sulfur-containing organosulfur compounds. Sulfur from drinking water is called inorganic sulfate. Well water and other drinking sources may have sulfur compounds. 

Food manufacturers often use sulfites as food preservatives to extend shelf life. Sulfites are derived from sulfur and are frequently added to packaged foods, such as pickles, jams, and dried fruit. Sulfites also develop naturally in fermented foods and drinks, for instance, wine, beer, and cider. A small percentage of people are sensitive to sulfite preservatives and might experience problems with some condiments, wine with added sulfites, beer, some canned and frozen foods, and pickled foods.
Alliaceous and cruciferous vegetables also provide a high percentage of the sulfur in people’s diets. This group includes broccoli, onion, garlic, cauliflower, and other veggies. These flavorful sulfur-rich foods are typically keto-friendly and versatile. Sulfurous veggies tend to be fibrous, steam well, and let off a unique, pungent odor that some people don’t particularly like. The smell is distinctive but goes away.

Some therapeutic diets, like Dr. Terry Wahl’s protocol, require consuming three cups of sulfur-containing foods daily, specifically from cruciferous veggies. </p>

    <p class = "abc"> Nothing conjures up the image of childhood more than a tray of freshly-baked chocolate chip cookies coming out of the oven. If you’re one of those people who loves baked goods, especially cookies, you might find yourself craving them on the keto diet. Keto offers a bit of grace for those who still want to indulge their sweet tooth, but it requires getting creative with ingredients. 

        Traditional cookies are not keto-friendly. However, modified keto cookies can be made using substitutions, and keto-friendly cookies can be found in many stores as well. Most keto recipes use almond flour or coconut flour, along with sugar substitutes like erythritol or stevia. If you plan to add some chocolate, make sure to use a keto-friendly variety.<br><b>Are Cookies Keto-Friendly? </b><br>
        As we mentioned, most cookies, whether store-bought or homemade, are not keto-friendly. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to make a keto cookie, and there’s nothing wrong with indulging in keto cookies from time to time. 
        
        While most people would not place cookies in the category of healthy foods, they can be a good way to incorporate a bit of fat into your daily diet. Many varieties are made with butter or even cream cheese. If you are careful about what ingredients you consume, you can easily whip up a batch that emphasizes these positive characteristics of cookies and doesn’t weigh you down with overall carb count. 
        
        Buying Keto Cookies at the Store
        Buying cookies at the store might be an exercise in futility if you plan to stick to a keto diet. While some health foods like the Quest cookie are great store-bought solutions when you need a snack in a pinch, they are pricey and often have higher carb counts than homemade versions.If you intend to make your own keto cookies, you will need to invest in some baking staples. First up, you will have to forgo the traditional flour used in baking and use a keto-friendly flour alternative. You have two main options to choose: almond flour or coconut flour. Both should be found in the baking aisle of your local grocery store or you can make your own almond flour at home in a food processor. Oat fiber (not oat flour) and flax meal can also be used as flour substitutes, though they are less commonly called for in recipes for sweet baked goods.<b><br>How do you decide which type of flour to use? </b><br>

        For the most part, coconut flour tends to produce drier cookies, which is great if you are looking for some crunch. On the other hand, almond flour is known for being heavier which ultimately makes a denser, moister cookie. If you are thinking of gooey chocolate chip cookies hot from the oven, almond flour may be the way to go. [1]
        
        There is another benefit to almond flour as well: its overall nutrition. It is higher in fat than coconut flour as well as lower in carbs, which is ideal for those who stick to a keto diet. Almond flour also contains micronutrients like manganese, magnesium, copper, and phosphorus, as well as lots of vitamin E (an essential component of a healthy immune system). Along with these benefits it also offers plenty of fiber for gut health and can help reduce insulin resistance. [2]
        
        To make keto cookies, you will also need to invest in some sweeteners that are keto-friendly, such as erythritol or stevia. Swerve brand sugars are also a great option if you need a keto substitute for traditional confectioner’s sugar or brown sugar. </p>

    <p> <h3>Is Green Tea Keto?</h3></p>
  </div>
  
  <article class="article-1">
    <p class = "abc"> Green tea originated in China, and today, green tea plants grow worldwide from Hawaii to Southeast Asia. Black tea and green tea are derived from the same plant species, Camellia sinensis, but have different flavor profiles because of differences in the way the leaves are processed.

        The way green tea is processed is believed to be responsible for its medicinal value. After the leaves are picked, they’re quickly heated and dried to prevent them from oxidizing. This results in a vibrant green hue and helps the tea leaves retain most of their vitamins and minerals. The varieties of green tea differ based on the type of C. sinensis, production, processing, growing conditions, and the time of harvest.
        
        Green tea is widely available, but higher-quality teas might be a little more expensive. Lower-quality teas should be steeped in hotter water for longer time periods, whereas higher-quality teas should typically be steeped multiple times in cooler water for shorter time periods. Steeping too long or too hot releases excessive tannins and creates a more bitter taste. Higher-quality green teas are plucked from verdant riverbanks and other suitable areas with rich terrain.<b><br>What is Matcha?<br></b>Matcha tea bushes are protected from sunlight for 20-30 days before harvest, which raises chlorophyll levels, increases amino acid production, and turns the leaves a darker shade of green. Following harvest, the veins and stems are removed from the leaves, and the rest of the leaf is stone ground into a fine green powder called matcha. Matcha is a powerful green tea powder from the same plant as green tea but prepared differently and believed to have stronger medicinal properties.

        Keto matcha powder
        When drinking matcha, you consume more of the whole leaf than with other varieties of green tea, resulting in higher caffeine and antioxidant consumption. Research indicates matcha can improve heart health and reduce skin damage from the sun.</p>
