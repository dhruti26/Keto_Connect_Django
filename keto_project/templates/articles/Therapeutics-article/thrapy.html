  <p> <h3>The Truth About Keto and Gout</h3></p>
</div>
<article class="article-1">
  <p class="abc"> Gout refers to painful and sudden swelling and inflammation of a joint, usually in the big toe, though it can also affect other joints like the heels, wrists, and fingers. Gout involves higher levels of uric acid in the blood, leading to crystals forming in the affected joint. The condition is more common in men and older adults. The cause of gout isn’t definitive. Excessive meat consumption has been blamed for gout. Uric acid (found in higher levels in people with gout) is a breakdown product of purines. Purines are the building blocks of protein and are found in higher concentrations in certain foods, including meat. Some people claim the purines from meats lead to higher uric acid levels in the blood. While weak observational studies support this claim, other studies show no association. [3]

    It isn’t exactly clear why the outcome of these studies differ, but one explanation could be the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and sugar consumption. Obesity and metabolic syndrome heighten your risk of developing gout. Other components of diet and lifestyle could account for these geographic differences. It’s tricky to differentiate between the effects of meat on gout compared to those of alcohol or refined grains and sugars. Healthy user bias must also be taken into account. Outside of the paleo and keto communities, generally speaking, people who eat large amounts of meat as part of a standard Western diet also tend to engage in other unhealthy behaviors that could increase gout risk, potentially skewing the outcome. For example, weak epidemiological studies don’t consider that, in their cases, people with gout also ate more total calories, had hypertension, and drank more alcohol. [4]

    Nutrition research can have conflicting results. One study revealed vegans had higher uric acid levels than fish and meat eaters. [5]
    
    Almost everything you eat has purines, but some foods contain more than others. While meat is obviously high in purine, other foods are as well. For example, soy meat substitutes and soybean flour can contain more purines than some meats and fish.
    
    Foods high in purines, like seafood, sardines, and grass-fed beef, are also particularly anti-inflammatory and nutritious, which could help counteract a tendency toward gout. On the other hand, if you’re having a gout flare-up or are concerned with persistent gout attacks, you might decide to limit your purine intake.</p>

    There are different types of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, and osteoarthritis.

    Gradual wear and tear and damage to the cartilage in the joints is called osteoarthritis. An infection or injury can worsen osteoarthritis. Severe osteoarthritis can lead to bone grinding on bone, which is particularly painful and restricts movement of the affected joint.
    
    Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis involve your immune system and widespread inflammation that can also affect the muscles and organ systems like the eyes. With these inflammatory conditions, the body’s own immune system attacks your joints, and they become swollen and inflamed. Over time, the disease process can destroy cartilage and bone. Inflammatory arthritic conditions could be associated with bacteria, genetics, and environmental factors.<b><br> What Are the Treatments for Arthritis?</b><br>
    Typical treatments for arthritis include: 
    
    Therapeutic exercise
    Assistive devices, such as a cane
    Nutritional counseling
    Weight loss if you’re obese or overweight
    Cold and heat therapies, like a warm compress or ice packs
    Medications like steroids, pain relief, biologics, and anti-inflammatories. ketogenic diet is being looked at as a preventive and treatment option for osteoarthritis. [7] One study compared a low-fat diet to a low-carb diet and concluded that a low-carbohydrate diet reduced the oxidative stress responsible for inflammation and arthritis </p>

<article class="article-1">
    <p class="abc"> Obesity affected 13% of adults globally in 2016 and obesity and metabolic disease are on the rise [1]. Obesity increases your risk for a plethora of conditions, including metabolic abnormalities and metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes [2,3].

        The ketogenic diet is one of the popular diets touted for improving metabolism via different mechanisms, such as limiting carbohydrates. Some research suggests lowering carbs might benefit those with obesity [4].
        
        When you reduce carbs and increase fat, your body enters a metabolic state called ketosis, where you turn fat into molecules called ketones. Your brain and body become more adapted and efficient at burning fat and ketones for energy after a few days or weeks of ditching carbs on a ketogenic diet.
        The ketogenic diet benefits the metabolism in numerous ways. Going keto lowers insulin levels, which can be helpful for blood sugar management and insulin sensitivity. Insulin is a digestive hormone that helps you store sugar in your cells. It’s also called the fat-storage hormone since it prompts you to hold on to your fat stores.

        When you’re not consuming too many carbs, you won’t require as much insulin, which can be beneficial for metabolism and fat loss [7]. People with metabolic syndrome have issues with insulin and blood sugar, so getting off the blood sugar rollercoaster that comes along with a high-carb diet can be pivotal.
        
        The risk factors of metabolic disease can be improved or eliminated with the right lifestyle and nutritional modifications. Keto diets have been shown to effectively reduce insulin levels, particularly for those with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.
        
        High insulin levels and insulin resistance can lead to a flurry of health issues, including inflammation, fat gain, and high triglyceride levels.
        
        One study revealed a 75% improvement in insulin sensitivity along with blood sugar drops after just 2 weeks on a keto diet [8]. Another 16-week study showed blood sugar levels dropped by 16%, and 7 of 21 participants were able to stop diabetic medication [9]. Other animal and human studies found improvements in total cholesterol </p>

    <p> <h3>Does a Ketogenic Diet Help with Anxiety?</h3></p>
  </div>
  
  <article class="article-1">
    <p class="abc">Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States, affecting 40 million adults every year, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) affects 6.8 million adults, and 6 million adults are dealing with panic disorder (PD). [1]

        While medication is helpful for many people, others choose not to use it or don’t respond well. It’s no secret that a ketogenic diet has long been used therapeutically for obesity, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, cognitive function, and inflammatory disorders, but can a ketogenic diet help with anxiety? Let’s look at the anecdotal and scientific evidence.Anxiety is an emotion or feeling of turmoil, discomfort, and unease, the sense that something isn’t right or something bad could happen in an instant at any time. Anxiety is a normal part of the fight-and-flight response to a stressful event, like a new job interview or an academic test in the modern world.

        Occasional anxiety is normal, particularly during periods of change or uncertainty. Sometimes anxiety can motivate you to make necessary difficult decisions or alert you to something that isn’t right or warrants attention.Frequent and/or severe anxiety, social anxiety, and panic attacks are another story, and they can have devastating consequences in your daily life. If your anxiety persists, worsens, and doesn’t go away after the short-term stressor, you might have an anxiety disorder. An anxiety disorder is usually characterized by excessive, worrisome thoughts about numerous parts of life persisting for six months or longer.

    <p> <h3>Can a High-Fat Diet Lower Blood Pressure?</h3></p>
  </div>
  <article class="article-1">
    <p class="abc"> he statistics on eating disorders are startling. Did you know that eating disorders have the highest mortality rate amongst any other psychiatric disorder? While eating disorders can affect anyone, females are disproportionately affected; ladies between 15-24 are 12x more likely to die from anorexia than any other cause of death. Currently, ~70 million people are suffering from an eating disorder. [1] [2] Diets and diet culture is often blamed for the high prevalence of eating disorders but, research suggests the ketogenic diet could actually be helpful. Is it possible going keto could be beneficial in the treatment of eating disorders?
        Research has proven the ketogenic diet beneficial for numerous conditions, including everything from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) to Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). Recently, researchers have begun to investigate the therapeutic benefits of the keto diet for cancer.

        It seems logical that a diet that significantly lowers glucose levels could be beneficial for a disease that is known to thrive on glucose. A key area of research being explored is the use of a ketogenic diet specifically for more aggressive forms of cancer, like anaplastic thyroid cancer.
        
        A study published in the journal Surgery in January of 2020 investigated that exact topic. In this study, titled Ketogenic diet combined with antioxidant N-acetylcysteine inhibits tumor growth in a mouse model of anaplastic thyroid cancer, researchers found exactly as the title suggests, a combination of the ketogenic diet and N-acetylcysteine inhibited anaplastic thyroid tumor growth in animal models. Here is a quick breakdown of this study, the methods, and conclusions.</p>
