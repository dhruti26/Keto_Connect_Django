  <p> <h3>Can Stress Raise Blood Sugar?</h3></p>
</div>
<article class="article-1">
  <p class="abc"> You might be surprised to hear that blood sugar is more complicated than diet alone. Several factors influence blood sugar outside of that sugar-loaded donut and Coca Cola. But what about stress? Does stress raise blood sugar? It seems today, in our modern world, plenty of people are stressed, and stress has been shown to cause a plethora of symptoms, from insomnia, headaches, and digestive issues to poor concentration, fatigue, and ulcers.

    Lots of keto dieters transition into a low-carb lifestyle to help regulate their blood sugar levels and achieve certain health or fitness goals. When you’re following a ketogenic diet, you’re on the right track to stabilizing your blood sugar, but other factors could be affecting it. Let’s discuss the relationship between stress and blood sugar.<b><br>Types of Stress</b><br>
    Stress is split into two categories: physical stress and emotional or mental stress. Mental or psychological stress can occur for various reasons, such as:
    
    Nervousness before a job interview or exam
    An argument with a spouse or loved one
    Going through a traumatic event or loss
    Your body synthesizes cortisol from cholesterol and releases cortisol from your adrenal glands. Cortisol is the primary stress hormone.

    When your body sends physical or emotional stress signals, your adrenal glands release certain hormones, namely cortisol, aldosterone, and adrenaline, to help you respond to the perceived threat. This is also known as the fight-or-flight response. Cortisol can prompt your liver to secrete glucose (sugar) and fatty acids to provide energy to deal with the emergency. <b><br>The Role of Insulin</b><br>
    Your body decreases insulin secretion when you have a higher serum cortisol level. Insulin is the digestive hormone that helps scuttle blood sugar into your cells to keep your blood sugar in check at safe levels. If insulin isn’t being released properly, blood sugar levels become unbalanced. [5]
    
    Chronic stress takes you on the road to chronically high levels of cortisol and lowered insulin secretion over time. High cortisol levels cause your body tissues to be less sensitive toinsulin, so there’s more blood sugar available in your bloodstream. When this occurs, blood sugar levels can become dangerously high, particularly if left untreated. 
    
    Stress is especially dangerous for those with diabetes because a blood sugar spike could cause too much sugar in the blood to pass into the urine and trigger the body to filter out fluid, potentially resulting in a diabetic coma or dehydration.Stress can also lead to blood sugar spikes in other ways. People who feel stressed are more likely to participate in behaviors that could lead to high blood sugar. For example, people who feel stressed might engage in emotional overeating of processed and refined carbohydrates and foods that are loaded with added sugars.

    People might give up on exercise and become more sedentary or forget to take medications if they’re supposed to. Stress can put a damper on your healthy habits.
    
    Because your HPA axis plays a role in stress and sleep, if you’re under high stress, your HPA axis may be prompting the production of extra cortisol, leading to changes in the HPA axis. Research shows stress could impair restful sleep and change sleeping patterns. Not getting sufficient sleep can cause glucose intolerance, resulting in a dysfunctional metabolism and high blood sugar levels.</p>

    <p><b>The Best Pre-Workout Keto Snacks</b></p>
  </div>
</div>
<article class="article-2">
  <p class="abc"> What you eat before hitting the gym–or wherever you work out–helps give you needed energy to fuel your body through your workout. When you’re following a ketogenic diet, you can’t just pick up any old snack. Whether you’re trying to build muscle, sprint or jog around the neighborhood, or achieve long-term fitness goals, you’ll need easy snack ideas with suitable fat and protein. 

    As you well know if you’re following a keto lifestyle, protein and fat are better fuel sources for endurance than carbs. Let’s break down the best pre-workout keto snacks in terms of convenience, energy, availability, and, most importantly, nutrition. 
    
   <b><br> Top Pre-Workout Keto Snacks</b><br>
    Here are some pre-workout keto snacks that don’t take long to prep and will keep you satisfied throughout your workout.A keto sandwich can be pretty convenient if you make your keto bread beforehand. Enjoy a smoked salmon and avocado sandwich or a good old-fashioned grilled cheese. 

    Roll-ups are also a quick choice. All you have to do is spread some cream cheese over a couple of thin slices of ham and roll them up! Add leaves of lettuce if you’d like, or get fancy with a prosciutto roll-up that uses your favorite cheese. <b>Salads</b> are one of the faster meals to make because they don’t usually involve cooking. You may not think of them as snacks, but you can split high-fat, high-protein salads into individual portions and store them in portable mason jars. Refrigerate the portions and eat them over the next two-three days, depending on the ingredients.

    Enjoy one of the following nutritious keto salad recipes:Egyptian Salad
    Greek Cauliflower Salad
    BLT Salad with Zesty Sesame Mustard Dressing
    Cauliflower Potato Salad
    Avocado Salad with Cucumber
    Cobb Salad

      <p><b>5 Easy Tips to Keep Keto During Your Labor Day Weekend</b></p>

<article class="article-1">
    <p class="abc"> We’ve all been there. You caved and ate all the carbs you were craving, and soon after, you needed a nap. Why do carbs make you tired? Why is it that when you binge on your favorite carb-loaded foods, you end up feeling foggy and fatigued? 

        On the other hand, when you’re following a ketogenic diet, your carb intake is limited, and you don’t succumb to the dreaded carb crash that goes with the <b>standard Western diet</b>. So let’s examine the reasons why carbohydrates can make you tired and how keto can help stabilize your energy levels.Fatigue is a common symptom of high blood sugar. Fatigue isn’t just a problem for diabetics; people with prediabetes or normal blood sugar levels can also feel fatigued if there’s a sudden spike in blood sugar.

        You spike your blood sugar by eating carbs (especially simple carbs) and sugar. The standard Western diet involves stepping aboard the blood sugar rollercoaster. Processed and packaged carb-rich treats and snacks are tasty and convenient, and it’s easy for many people to overeat them.Insulin stores sugar in your cells to use for energy and to prevent your blood sugar levels from climbing dangerously high. When sugar, rather than ketones, are your cells’ main source of energy, you could end up feeling tired if you have insufficient or inefficient insulin. When insulin isn’t properly scuttling sugar into your cells or when your cells aren’t able to respond to insulin, your cells are left lacking energy. Hyperglycemia or high blood sugar levels happens when there are too many sugars consumed, and insulin isn’t able to do its job.

        If you eat too much sugar over time, your pancreas can get worn out, and your cells can become more resistant to insulin—a condition called insulin resistance. Put simply, the functioning of your metabolism can be thrown off by a high-sugar diet as your pancreas tries to produce and release enough insulin to manage the excessive influx of sugar.
        
        When you eat a <b>high-carb meal</b>, you’ll feel a surge of energy followed by a depleting crash as your blood sugar levels rise and fall. If your blood sugar drops too low, it’s called hypoglycemia, which stresses your body and prompts the release of the stress hormone cortisol. Repeating this cycle of frequent high blood sugar and cortisol surges can be detrimental to your metabolism and adrenal glands. Maintaining balance is key with all hormones in your body. A study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition revealed that high consumption of added starches, sugars, and refined grains was associated with a greater risk of sleep deprivation in postmenopausal women. The researchers speculate this is due to carb-rich foods triggering stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline and causing blood sugar imbalances that inhibit sleep.

        In another example, an interesting study showed that a shift in blood sugar levels due to a high-carb diet makes it more difficult to get a full night of uninterrupted sleep.
        
        Of course, not all carbs are equal, and natural, unprocessed carbs don’t have the same glycemic load on the body. Even so, healthier carbs like sweet potatoes and beans also impact your blood sugar, and eating too many of them could also leave you feeling a little tired.
        
        Food allergies have also been shown to promote post-meal tiredness, so it’s important to differentiate between food allergies and carb crashes </p>

    <p> <h3>Can You Lose Weight Without Exercise on the Keto Diet?</h3></p>
  </div>
  
  <article class="article-1">
    <p class="abc"> The key to the ketogenic diet is achieving the metabolic state of ketosis at which point your body burns stored fat instead of carbohydrates for energy. As a result, you lose body fat and, as an added bonus, research shows your mood improves. [1]

        To reach ketosis, getting the right balance of macronutrients (aka macros)—carbs, protein, fats—is essential. Because that looks different for every person, a good place to kickstart going keto is calculating the optimal breakdown specific to you. Roughly speaking, the ketogenic protocol calls for 75% fat, 20% protein, and 5% carbohydrates. The overarching idea is to scale down on the carbs and replace them with protein and healthy fats.<b><br>What Can I Eat on Keto? </b><br>
        Once you’ve established your macros, set yourself up for success with keto-approved meal planning. Stock your kitchen with whole, unprocessed foods (think: avocado, grass-fed beef, seafood, berries, and leafy greens), while leaving the likes of bread, starchy vegetables, legumes, and sugary drinks at the door.<b> Intermittent fasting</b>—a way of eating that switches between periods of fasting and eating—when paired with keto can produce even greater improvements to your health. One of the most popular methods of intermittent fasting is the 16:8 method. It calls to have a “feeding window” of eight hours and then a fasting period of 16 hours which usually takes place overnight. For example, if you wake up at 6am, delay your first meal until 10am (you can still have your morning pick-me-up!) and end your window of meals by 6pm.Because of the typical reduced caloric intake that comes with intermittent fasting, it can lead to not only greater weight loss, but also enhanced metabolic health. Furthermore, according to a recent study, intermittent fasting has a positive effect on cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes. [3]

        However you choose to approach your foray into the keto diet, keep in mind that it’s your unique journey—do what feels right for you. And you don’t have to let the fear of sweating it out at the gym keep you from reaping the benefits of embarking on the keto lifestyle.
        
        
        
        Not sure what to make for dinner? Keep it simple with salmon served with asparagus and bell peppers cooked in ghee or whip up grilled chicken fajita kabobs.</p>
